# Office-Organization (Algorithms and Design)

Your office becomes full of documents. You currently have N units of documents on your office, 
and your father demands that you have exactly M units of documents left by the end of the day
(M < N). The only hope for you now is to ask help from your brother and sister.
Your sister offers that she can reduce your documents by half for $A (rounding down when 
necessary).
Your brother offers that he can reduce your entire documents by one unit for $B 
Note that work can never be reduced to less than 0.
Given N, M, A and B, your task is to find the minimum costs in MOST EFFICIENT WAY to 
organize your office to meet your father's needs.
